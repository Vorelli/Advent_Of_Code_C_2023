#+title: AoC Day 9
* Part 1
** Notes
*** Looks pretty straightforward. Recursively process lines to find their next element.
*** Only return if the next simulation returns 0. Then return the previous value.
*** Above that, we just add the previoius element to the returned number.
** Cases
*** Case x
**** Given:
#+NAME: Example x
#+BEGIN_SRC <text>
0 3 6 9 12 15 -> 18
1 3 6 10 15 21 -> 28
10 13 16 21 30 45 -> 68
#+END_SRC
**** Return: 114 ( SUM OF ALL NEXT NODES )
** Ideas
** Tasks
*** Write function for next element in sequence (char *)
**** Parses all numbers in the sequence into an array (long[])
**** Feeds into recursive function
*** Recursive Function
**** DONE Generates diff array (an array of size - 2) which contains differences between elements

**** DONE Follow rules above

***** return if all 0
***** otherwise, return received + previous element in array
