#+title: AoC Day 8
* Part 1
** Notes
*** We start at a node (AAA) which can be labeled by any three characters. Our objective is to follow the instruction given (L for left, R for right) as many repeats as it takes to find the node ZZZ.
**** Each node points to a left node and a right node.
** Cases
*** Case 1
**** Given:
#+NAME: Example 1
#+BEGIN_SRC <text>
RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (ZZZ, GGG)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
#+END_SRC
**** Return: 2
***** AAA -> R (CCC) -> L (ZZZ) Found ZZZ after 2 steps
*** Case 2
**** Given:
#+NAME: Example 2
#+BEGIN_SRC <text>
LLR

AAA = (BBB, BBB)
BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
#+END_SRC
**** Return: 6
***** AAA -> L (BBB) -> L (AAA) -> R (BBB) -> L (AAA) -> L (BBB) -> R (ZZZ) Found ZZZ after 6 steps
*** Case x
**** Given:
#+NAME: Example x
#+BEGIN_SRC <text>
#+END_SRC
**** Return: x

** Ideas
*** Parse nodes into "node-like" structures and hold them within a map. Each look up will be O(1) and then it's all about repeating the instructions over and over.
** Tasks
*** TODO Create Hash Map in C
*** TODO Write parsing algorithm for instruction
*** TODO Write parsing algorithm for nodes
*** TODO Tie it all together
